# Intelligent Transportation Survey App

A simple text-based Python app that collects public opinions on transportation challenges and smart mobility solutions.

##  Why I Built This

This project marks the beginning of my journey into Python and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). I set out to build something simple yet purposeful ‚Äî a survey app that gathers public insights on transportation issues and ideas for smarter cities.

While basic in structure, this project reflects a deeper goal: to explore how human feedback and data can power future research in AI, Connected & Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), and inclusive urban mobility.

I'm sharing this as a learning milestone and a public invitation to collaborate, learn, and grow with others in the mobility, research, and tech communities.

##  Features

- Simple, interactive command-line interface
- Stores responses using Python dictionaries
- Simulates real-world polling for transportation data
- Lays foundation for future upgrades (e.g., .csv export, analytics, Streamlit UI)

##  What's Next

- CSV export for collected survey data
- Simple data analytics dashboard
- Streamlit web app version
- Integrate feedback from professors, researchers, and peers

##  Connect
